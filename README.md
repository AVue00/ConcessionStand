# The Concession Stand

## Description

This project is a concession stand ordering app. It features a login page when first launching. Users can login or create a new user from this loading page. Once logged in concession stand products are displayed and can be added to a cart for order. After filling the cart, an order can be submitted with a checkout button. Once checked out, the order has been logged and can be from Order History page in the Navbar at the top of the Buyer-Dashboard page.
